# data_cleaning_using_pandas_matplotlib
Data cleaning project where there are thousands of police record arresting individuals for different violations. It contains the person's age, gender, violation date and time and violation type. Initially it had a lot of missing/NaN vially it alues so it had to be cleaned before making a proper report on the data. I have used Pandas to clean the data and Matplotlib for making reports.
