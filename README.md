This study examines trends in driver demographics, infractions, and the results of arrests and searches by analyzing a dataset of police traffic stops.  The objective is to use Python tools like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to illustrate important insights, handle missing values, and clean up the data.

Columns include: driver_gender, driver_age, driver_race, violation, stop_outcome, is_arrested, stop_duration, search_conducted, drugs_related_stop, stop_datetime

Following data analysis was done in this project-

1)Null and duplicate rows were eliminated.

2)Created a single datetime column by converting the date and time.

3)Changed "other," "n/a," and "0s" to "unknown" or suitable values.

4)Substituted the column's mean for the driver_age's missing numerical values.

Visualizations Created

1)Distribution of driver gender

2)Distribution of driver race

3)Most common violations

Tools/libraries used- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
